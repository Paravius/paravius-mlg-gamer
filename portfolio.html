<h5>SIR PARAVIUS INSIGHTS - EXISTENCE<br><br>
When I kept growing and growing, this is what my result is. My very own, original, and astonishing Insights of Sir Paravius. (All my own ideas. Despite my hardcore gaming trait, surprisingly, I think deeper than most people. Here are some of my deep thoughts. I like thinking about the biggest things in the whole universe.)<br>
Just a sample of my wisdom:<br>
Without darkness there would be no light. Without bad there would be no good. The definition and appreciation of a concept highly depends upon its opposite. Without difference there would be no existence. But since there is a lot of opposites existing in the universe varying in degrees and levels, existence is possible. But then it gives way to positive forces and negative forces, via perception of embodiments of life. Then "real" life follows.</h5>
